# Epileptic Seizure Classification - A Deep Learning Approach ‚ö°

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify epileptic seizures using a deep learning approach. By leveraging modified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between seizure and non-seizure events based on EEG data.

## Abstract

Epileptic seizure disorder is characterized by recurrent seizures due to abnormal brain activity. This project utilizes a modified CNN for seizure detection and classification, achieving a testing classification accuracy of **98%** and a validation accuracy of **97%**. The model's architecture includes batch normalization, dense layers with ReLU activation, and dropout layers to capture complex EEG patterns and prevent overfitting.

## Dataset Details üìä

- **Source:** EEG recordings from 500 individuals, each monitored for 23.6 seconds.
- **Segments:** Each recording is divided into 23 segments of 178 data points, resulting in a total of **11,500 data pieces**.
- **Categories:** The EEG recordings are classified into five categories:
  - Seizure activity
  - Tumor presence
  - Healthy brain region activity
  - Eyes closed
  - Eyes open
